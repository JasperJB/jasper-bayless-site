                <h3>Tags for Pinnipeds (Seals, marine mammals)</h3>
                <p>Student design consultant on NOAA- and Cal Poly Humboldt–sponsored pinniped flipper tag redesign. Worked with client liaison Dr. Dawn Goley to translate field requirements into engineering criteria. Utilized CAD, cost analysis, and iterative prototyping (FDM 3D printing, silicone molding, and basic machining) to develop a durable, legible three-piece tag system compatible with existing applicators, which was accepted as a viable path toward future field implementation.</p>
